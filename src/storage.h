/*
 * storage.h
 *
 * Simple storage layer for managing a phonebook and audio recordings
 * on a W25Q32 serial NOR flash.  The design reserves the first 4 kB
 * sector of flash for a header structure containing phone numbers,
 * offsets and lengths for up to 16 recordings, and a CRC for
 * integrity.  Subsequent sectors are used to store the raw audio
 * payloads.  The API exposes functions to initialise the flash,
 * save/retrieve phone numbers and save/read recordings.  All
 * operations update the header and persist it back to flash.
